    "We introduce a new embedding approach of periodic systems onto a nonperiodic isolated environment through subsystem-DFT (Frozen Denisty Embedding method (FDE|)). Furhtermore we use this approach to calculate the ionzation potential (IP) of an ionic crystal relative to the isolated calculation. For this we introduce a new formalism to evaluate total energies for charged systems. We show the usage of our method through the calculation of IPs for NaCl with an increasing system size. A long the way we are clearifying the procedure of periodic in nonperiodic embedding apporaches which in our opinion isn't always the case."

    "The accuracy of determining properties of systems is strongly correlated with computational cost. For this reason post Hartree-Fock methods like CI or CC are only accessible to a small system size. This problem led to a variety of embedding approaches in which the influence of the surrounding onto the fragment (subsystem) of interest is represented by an appropriate embedding potential $v_\\mathrm{emb}$. $v_\\mathrm{emb}$ is generate by a lower computational cost and also less accuracy. The properties of the smaller subsystem of interest can then be evaluated with a higher level of accuracy.\n",

The advantage however is that bigger systems are accesseible. Furthermore the non-additive kinetic energy part is already included and doesn't need to be calculated in a later stage.

In contrast to this we also present the possiblity to use the calculated embedding potential in a regular molecular basis set code. To the best of our knowledge this is the first approach to perform periodic in  nonperiodic embedding within a purely plane wave framework. So far only DFT-in-DFT embedding methods where used but in the future also WF-DFT approaches are planned to be realized."
