Furthermore we use this approach to calculate the ionzation potential (IP) of an ionic crystal relative to the isolated calculation. For this we introduce a new formalism to evaluate total energies for charged systems. We show the usage of our method through the calculation of IPs for NaCl with an increasing system size. A long the way we are clearifying the procedure of periodic in nonperiodic embedding apporaches which in our opinion isn't always the case."

This concept gives alot of advantages compared to regular KS-DFT. In the context of frozen density embedding (FDE) big system can be computationally reachable within a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore embedding approaches can be used in a DFT in DFT or WF in DFT context. Through a relative inexpansive but still reasonable calulation of the enviromnet an embeddig potential $v_\\mathrm{emb}$, which describes the interaction from the enviromnet onto the subsystem, can be obtained.
