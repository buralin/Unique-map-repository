    "\n",
    "Martyna-Tuckerman introduced a method based on a reciprocal space formalism for treating longrange interactions in cluster systems. Through this method interactions from periodic images with the unit cell are cut off.\n",

    "It is important to mention that the coulomb operator is still periodic and therefore standart FFT techniques can be used.\n",

    "This is achieved by introducing a screening potential which screens out interactions of the unit cell with neighbouring cells. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that only the longrange part of the coulomb interaction need to be considered in this case. In the screening potential the difference between the fourier series and the fourier transform of the longrange part of the coulomb interaction cuts of the interaction of neighbouring cells. It is assumed that in case of the short range interaction both quantities are the same when the unit cell is chosen large enough."

    "We are introducing a new formalism which allows the mapping of periodic potentials onto a collection of finite systems.\n",
    "This is achieved by calculating an appropriate embedding potential $v_\\mathrm{emb}$ of the crystal surrounding for one isolated fragment. For this purpose it is useful to calculate this $v_\\mathrm{emb}$ using a subsystem-DFT approach with periodic boundary conditions.\n",

    "For the calculation of ionizationpotentials through mapping of properties two appropriate $v_\\mathrm{eff,I}$ are needed. In the case for a not ionized fragment one can use the map introduced above.\n",

    "In the case of the ionized fragment the potential $v_\\mathrm{tot}[\\rho_\\mathrm{tot}]$ must be a potential which only includes one 'impurity' or in other words only one ionized fragment. As we have seen in the unique map this is again a not trivial task in periodic boundary conditions. For this reason we introduce a 'half coupled' method to calculate $v_\\mathrm{tot}[\\rho_\\mathrm{tot}]$ in the impurity case.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our idea is to calculate $\\hat{\\phi}^{\\mathrm(screen)}_\\mathrm{I}$ for the not ionized system at the end of the calculation. In the next step this is imported in a calculation with the ionized fragment.\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\Delta \\hat{\\phi}^{\\mathrm(screen)}_\\mathrm{I}$ can be seen as an function which is replacing the surrounding which is ionized with a surrounding of a not ionized fragment. Of course this is a simplification because we are only taking into account coulomb interactions and only the effect of the surrounding onto the fragment and not vice versa. Furthermore The interaction of the other fragments (in the unit cell and the surrounding) are still interacting with the ionized fragment.\n",
